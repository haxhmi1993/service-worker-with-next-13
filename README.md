# Next.js 13 App with Service Worker Caching

Welcome to the README file for our public GitHub project, showcasing the usage of a service worker to cache requests for a Next.js 13 app router. In this project, we have implemented a service worker to cache data for the `dashboard` and `profile` pages of our Next.js app. Additionally, we have optimized the `profile` page endpoint to retrieve data from the service worker cache after the initial request.

## Introduction

Our project demonstrates the integration of a service worker into a Next.js 13 application to provide efficient caching and improve performance. We focus on caching requests for the `dashboard` and `profile` pages. The goal is to reduce network requests and enhance user experience by serving cached data when possible.

## Installation

To get started with our project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Install project dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
```
4. Build the Next.js app:
```bash
 npm run build
```

##Usage
After completing the installation steps, you can run the Next.js app using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the development server, allowing you to access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.


##Service Worker and Caching
We have implemented a service worker in our Next.js 13 app to intercept and cache network requests. This helps improve performance by serving cached resources when the user revisits the app. The service worker caches data for the dashboard and profile pages.

##Profile Page Optimization
A notable feature of our project is the optimization of the profile page. Initially, when the user accesses the profile endpoint, the data is fetched from the server and cached by the service worker. Subsequent requests to the profile endpoint will be served from the service worker cache, reducing unnecessary network requests.
